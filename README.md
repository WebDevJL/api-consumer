api-consumer
============

PHP class to build API params, connection url, and expected result format (xml, json).

I am not 100% certain what will come of this repo, but at first I want to at least add an API consuming class I use to connect to various API's created by a few different providers.

At some future point I will also need to include some sort of Curl class, and possibly another class to parse XML and/or JSON results to an array for easier usage.  However, I will create the initial class to expect JSON results from the API and parse it to an array for consumption.
